CS 536: Lab 1, Part 2:
README:

  Important Notes:
    1) To terminate the client/server processes please hit ctrl + c. This makes
    sure that any fifo created are deleted. In the cases of an un-expected
    proccess termination, fifos will not be deleted.

  Files:
    1) server.c
      Implementation of the server. This is an implementation which when run
      models a simple server. The server accepts requests from clients using
      a FIFO and executes the client requests using execvp and then prints
      the output to its stdout.

    2) client.c
      Implementation of the client. This is an implementation which when run,
      models a simple client. The client sends requests to the server using a
      FIFO.

    3) parser.c
      Implements the parser function as described in the handout.

    4) parser.h
      Header file for parser.c

    5) makefile
      make file to compile and generate the executables. run 'make' to comile
      and generate execuatebles named commandserver.bin and commandclient.bin
      respectively for server and client. run 'make clean' to remove the
      executables and object files.


  Testing:
    1) run 'make'
    2) run 'commandserver.bin'
    3) run 'commandclient.bin' in another terminal.
    4) send a request from the client terminal. The output should be seen on the
       server terminal.
    5) For multiple clients run 'commandclient' in multiple terminals.
    6) To stop execution, hit ctrl + c on the process you want to terminate.

    Note: Run server before client. Running client before will give an error "No
    FIFO found" as mentioned in the handout.
