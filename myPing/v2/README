README:

  Important Notes:
    1) To terminate the client/server processes please hit ctrl + c. Interuupt
       handlers make sure that the sockets are closed properly. Incase of an
       error message please run both the client and the server again.

  Files:
    1) recommandserver.c
      Implementation of the server. This is an implementation which when run
      models a simple server. The server accepts requests from clients using
      sockets under TCP protocol and executes the client requests using execlp
      and then writes the output to the respective client's socket.

    2) recommandclient.c
      Implementation of the client. This is an implementation which when run,
      models a simple client. The client sends requests to the server using a
      socket under TCP protocol and then reads from the socket to print out the
      command executions output to its STDOUT.

    3) makefile
      make file to compile and generate the executables. run 'make' to comile
      and generate execuatebles named recommandserver.bin and recommandclient.bin
      respectively for server and client. run 'make clean' to remove the
      executables and object files.


  Testing:
    1) run 'make'
    2) run 'recommandserver.bin %s_ip_addr %s_port_no'
    3) run 'recommandclient.bin %s_ip_addr %s_port_no' in another terminal.
    4) send a request from the client terminal. The output should be seen on the
       client terminal.
    5) For multiple clients run 'recommandclient' in multiple terminals.
    6) To stop execution, hit ctrl + c on the process you want to terminate.
